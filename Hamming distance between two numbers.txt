*********************problem********************
Find the hamming distance between two numbers ?
Hamming distance is the distance by which two number differs from each other.

Ex. :-
	let x =1010    y= 0101
	
	here at all position bits of x and y are distinct so the hamming distance is 4;

*********************code**************************

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int hamming(int x)
{
    int cnt=0;
    while(x)
    {
        cnt++;
        x &=x-1;
    }
    return cnt;
}

int main()

{
    int x,y;
    cin>>x>>y;
    x=x^y;
    cout<<hamming(x);
    return 0;
}
